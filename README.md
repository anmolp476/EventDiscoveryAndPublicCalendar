# Welcome

Welcome to the team 2's Event Discovery and Public Calendar sub-project, as part of the larger CampusConnect Project. Over here you will be able to find events that multiple organizers have created, be able to use multiple filters to filter through them, and use the built-in calendar views to see any events happening today, this week, or this month!
